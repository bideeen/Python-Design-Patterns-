# Python Design Patterns

## A. What is Design Pattern?

- A Design Pattern is a description or template that can be repeatedly applied to a commonly recurring problem in software design.

- Design Pattern is very useful when planning, discussing, managing and documenting your applications.


## B. Types of Design Pattern
There are 3 different types of design patterns. These design patterns are listed below:
- [Creational Patterns](https://github.com/bideeen/Python-Design-Patterns-/tree/main/Creational%20Patterns)
   - These pattern abstracts the instantiation process so that there is a logical seperation between how objects are composed and finally represented.

   - Kind of Creational Patterns 
        - [Abstract Factory](https://github.com/bideeen/Python-Design-Patterns-/tree/main/Creational%20Patterns/Abstract%20Factory)
        - [Builder](https://github.com/bideeen/Python-Design-Patterns-/tree/main/factory)
        - [Factory](https://github.com/bideeen/Python-Design-Patterns-/tree/main/Creational%20Patterns/factory)
        - [Prototype](https://github.com/bideeen/Python-Design-Patterns-/tree/main/factory)
        - [Singleton](https://github.com/bideeen/Python-Design-Patterns-/tree/main/factory)
   
- Structural Patterns
   - These pattern focuses on how classes and object are composed using the different structural techniques, and to form structuress with more or altered flexibility.

   - Kind of Structural Patterns 
        - [Adapter](https://github.com/bideeen/Python-Design-Patterns-/tree/main/factory)
        - [Bridge](https://github.com/bideeen/Python-Design-Patterns-/tree/main/factory)
        - [Composite](https://github.com/bideeen/Python-Design-Patterns-/tree/main/factory)
        - [Decorator](https://github.com/bideeen/Python-Design-Patterns-/tree/main/factory)
        - [Facade](https://github.com/bideeen/Python-Design-Patterns-/tree/main/factory)
        - [Flyweight](https://github.com/bideeen/Python-Design-Patterns-/tree/main/factory)
        - [Proxy](https://github.com/bideeen/Python-Design-Patterns-/tree/main/factory)

- Behavioral Patterns
   - These pattern is mostly concerned with the inner algorithms, process flow, the assignment of responsibilities and the intercommunication between objects.

   - Kind of Behavioral Patterns 
        - [Chain of Responsibility](https://github.com/bideeen/Python-Design-Patterns-/tree/main/factory)
        - [Command](https://github.com/bideeen/Python-Design-Patterns-/tree/main/factory)
        - [Interpreter](https://github.com/bideeen/Python-Design-Patterns-/tree/main/factory)
        - [Iterator](https://github.com/bideeen/Python-Design-Patterns-/tree/main/factory)
        - [Mediator](https://github.com/bideeen/Python-Design-Patterns-/tree/main/factory)
        - [Mementor](https://github.com/bideeen/Python-Design-Patterns-/tree/main/factory)
        - [Observer](https://github.com/bideeen/Python-Design-Patterns-/tree/main/factory)
        - [State](https://github.com/bideeen/Python-Design-Patterns-/tree/main/factory)
        - [Strategy](https://github.com/bideeen/Python-Design-Patterns-/tree/main/factory)
        - [Template](https://github.com/bideeen/Python-Design-Patterns-/tree/main/factory)
        - [Visitor](https://github.com/bideeen/Python-Design-Patterns-/tree/main/factory)

## C. Class and Object Scopes Patterns

- Class Scopes Patterns
  - These are patterns that deals with relationships between classes and their subclasses.
  - Examples od Class Scope patterns are:
    - Factory and Abstract Factory - ***Creational pattern***
      - They defers object creation to subclasses
    - Interpreter and Template - ***Behavioral pattern***
      - It describes algorithms and flow control
- Objects Scopes Patterns
  - These are patterns that deals more with relationship that can be altered at runtime.
    - Builder, Prototype and Singleton - ***Creational pattern***
      - it defers object creation to object
    - Adapter, Bridge, Composite, Decorator, Facade, Flyweight, Proxy - ***Strutural pattern***
      - it describes a way to assemble objects.
    - Chain of Responsibility, Command, Iterator, Mediator,Memento, Observer, State, Strategy, Visitor - ***Behavioral pattern***
      - it describes how group of objects co-operate
